# Hackers Poulette

## Presentation

![Hackers Poulette's logo](assets/img/logo.png)

A PHP project I made during my formation at **[BeCode](https://www.becode.org/)** (see [the directives here ! :fr:](https://github.com/becodeorg/Turing-promo-4/tree/master/projects/1-Formulaire)).

I tried to clean up code and respect the **[PSR](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/)**. Feel free to contact me if ou see anything wrong ! I really want to improve my programming's habits.
